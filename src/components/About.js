          <p>
            The idea of Maikei originated in Bangalore in 2019, The People
            Asking About Manipur And I explained too Beauties & Culture, I
            started thinking what youngsters deserve and I spent 3 years working
            on it and developing it And It was then that I felt a strong connect
            to Manipur and missed home immensely. I felt a need to be closer to
            my people and be around them
